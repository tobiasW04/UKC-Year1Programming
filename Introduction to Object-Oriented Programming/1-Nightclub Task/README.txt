The NightClub class models the operations of a nightclub management system, focusing on managing the club's occupancy, capacity, and name. The system provides basic functionalities such as adding clubbers, checking space availability for new entrants, handling departures, and printing nightclub details. The class is designed to simulate real-world constraints like capacity limits and ensures that occupancy numbers are accurately maintained.

--> Creating simple methods, how to work with parameters and return types

--> Getters and Setters

--> Javadoc documentation

--> General Coding standards
