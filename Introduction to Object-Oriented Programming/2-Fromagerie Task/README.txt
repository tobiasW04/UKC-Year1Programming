This project involves developing a software system to manage the inventory of a Fromagerie (cheese shop) by creating and manipulating classes that represent individual cheeses and the collection of cheeses available in the shop.

This task went more into core features of java such as:

--> Object oriented Programming with a class that uses another class

--> Collections and Iterations

--> More complex methods

--> Using the main method to test the code
